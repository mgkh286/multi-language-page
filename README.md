## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- javascript funtions and event listeners

### What I learned

- Implementing variable width flexbox layouts.
- Creating scripts using js.

### Continued development

I would like to learn and use Flexbox in order to create the same column layout. Also responsive design is still not my strength and so would like to deep dive on that area.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - It is a very good resource where you can find lot of tutorials, references, and examples of HTML and CSS styles. I'd recommend this to anyone who is starting off with web development and designing.

- [Mdn documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) - I learned using eventlistener from this documentation. It was pretty useful and easy to understand with lots of examples.
