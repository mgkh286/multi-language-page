			<p class="description">Programming is the process of writing instructions and directing commands to a computer or any other device such as DVD readers or audio and video receivers in modern communication systems, to direct this device and inform it how to deal with data or how to perform a series of required actions called an algorithm. The programming process follows rules specific to the language chosen by the programmer. Each programming language has its own characteristics that distinguish it from the other and make it suitable to varying degrees for each type of program and according to the task required of this program. </p>
